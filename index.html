# what is truly the point of life?

**we will all die.** it's in fact inevitable. just me typing this has no meaning. all your feelings will eventually decay, your parents will die. **you**, will die. everything is temporary. maybe I'm just feeling this way as a phase, but i truly don't think so. i dont know whats after death, in fact none of us do. so what's the fucking point? you feel pain but its gone you feel emotions yet they seize your body will decompose. you will never be eternally remembered. your entire life is just a trial, a trial that will eventually expire. the after-life may or may not be true. but does it even matter? if it is true you will stay longing for death, but you will never grasp it. if it isn't, you will stay longing for life-yet its out of reach. your grades, your achievements, your feats, your emotions. no one, not a single person, will remember them, not even yourself. the money you make the estate you buy the job you get, do **you** really think it matters once your dead? i guess the most you could do is live your life happy, yet that doesn't even matter because once your dead you wont remember that. my life is fucking pointless and so is yours. maybe I'm just fucking slow, but my whole motivation for living is gone. everything just doesn't matter to me anymore. sure i can have fun, but at the core, it doesn't _fucking_ matter. maybe you think you are sent to another universe, multiverse, fucking omniverse, but does it matter? you will die in EVERY SINGLE ONE. and yet you will still eventually meet your end. thanks for hearing me out. if this is gone, i found **it** out

        <h2>answer</h2>
        <p>

i thought about it and, i dont think there is a point in life. sure i want to do a lot of things but i dont think theres any point at the end. some people think its a bit depressing that im lowering my standards or lowering myself in general, but i kind of like it. I like how i can do whatever i want knowing it wont matter when i die (most of the time atleast). Therefore i just have one statement. do whatever you want. it really doesnt matter in the end, so dont be all sad and depressed just because something happened to you, go out there and make something of your life! marry someone, travel the world, maybe even have some children, but what your doing now doesnt even matter, in the future no one will remember you so that gives you the excuse to do whatever you want, right? talk with people, be nice, be mean, it doesnt matter. just do whatever you want and thats the true way to happiness. this will be my last entry. 11:15PM 12/27/24</p>
